# Blynk
An IOT simple project


********Blynk is the most popular Internet of Things platform for connecting any hardware to the cloud, designing apps to control them, and managing your deployed products at scale.********

*With Blynk Library you can connect over 400 hardware models (including ESP8266, ESP32, NodeMCU, all Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, Particle, Texas Instruments, etc.)to the Blynk Cloud. Full list of supported hardware can be found here.*

*With Blynk apps for iOS and Android apps you can easily drag-n-drop graphic interfaces for any DIY or commercial project. It's a pure WYSIWG experience: no coding on iOS or Android required.*

*Hardware can connect to Blynk Cloud (open-source server) over the Internet using hardware connectivity available on your board (like ESP32), or with the use of various shields (Ethernet, WiFi, GSM, LTE, etc). Blynk Cloud is available for every user of Blynk for free. Direct connection over Bluetooth is also possible.**
